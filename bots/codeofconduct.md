Code of Conduct
-

* **Be Aware of Your Surroundings:** When acting in official capacity (e.g. posting a transcription), if someone asks you a question, remember that you are temporarily the face of \/r/TranscribersOfReddit. Be courteous and friendly, and if you don't know how to answer, refer the user to [the ToR FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/index), an announcement post we've made in their subreddit, or [ask one of us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTranscribersOfReddit). **It is always better to not answer than answer incorrectly.** A useful way of responding might be: "I'm not sure about that, myself, but one of our moderators like \/u/captcoe or \/u/itsthejoker might be able to answer that for you."

* **Use Formal Language:** When talking to other users in your capacity as a Transcriber, please always use (relatively) formal language and proper grammar (capitalization, no abbreviations, and punctuation as appropriate). 

* **Respect the Formatting:** In an ideal world, transcriptions that you make should be indistinguishable from ones another redditor would make when working as a Transcriber of Reddit. **This is really, really important.** Continued and blatant disregard for proper formatting *will* be met with repercussions. Our content formatting is what first impressions are based on, and we need to always make a good first impression. 

* **Ask Us if You Need Help:** If you have any questions or find yourself in a situation that you cannot properly resolve, please send us a message [at the modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTranscribersOfReddit) or ping us through username so that we can assist.

Penalties
-

Failure to follow the above rules is, at moderator's combined discretion, worthy of a temporary ban of 7 days. If issues continue, a permanent ban may be issued. (We really don't want to do this.) The thing to remember here is that we're here to do a service for those who need it, and we need to stay focused and on target. If there is some issue that prevents us from adequately doing that service, it's something we need to (and will) address.
