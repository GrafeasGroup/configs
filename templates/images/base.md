**Note:** To use these format guides, all you have to do is copy and paste everything after the line break and before the line break preceding "*END*", and replace the carets and the values inside them. The two asterisks turn any text between them into boldtext, and the three hyphens in a row when separated by a blank row above and below will become a horizontal rule. 

**Remember:** We want to transcribe the text directly, please do not make corrections to typos or grammatical errors, but feel free to use [sic] to indicate that the text is exactly as in the original. Please copy and paste any emojis into your transcription.
