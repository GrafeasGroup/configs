**Note:** To use these format guides, all you have to do is copy and paste everything after the line break and before the line break preceding "*END*", and replace the carets and the values inside them. The two asterisks turn any text between them into boldtext, and the three hyphens in a row when separated by a blank row above and below will become a horizontal rule. 

**PLEASE** refer to our general guidelines which apply to every format guide. **ESPECIALLY** if this is your first time transcribing.
