**Useful Notes:**

* For videos shorter than one hour  
 Time: mm:ss --> (00:00)
* For videos longer than one hour:  
 Time: hh:mm:ss --> (00:00:00)
* Make a new timestamp anytime something happens to break the flow of audio, like a presenter finishing a paragraph, a large cut in the video, or something similar. You don't have to do it for every single line of dialogue. 
* There are **two spaces** after the timestamp, then a **return/enter** to make it look:
 
like  
this

* ...instead of:

like

this

* We **highly recommend** using [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/) to help you with transcribing videos. Just give it the file or YouTube link to the video you are transcribing and copy / paste your finished work to the comment fields.
