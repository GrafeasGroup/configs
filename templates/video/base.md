**Special Notes**

* For videos shorter than one hour  
 Time: mm:ss --> (00:00)
* For videos longer than one hour:  
 Time: hh:mm:ss --> (00:00:00)
* Only create a new timestamp for breaks to the flow of audio (e.g. presenter finishes a paragraph, cut in the video...)
* Please put **Two spaces** and a **return/enter** after the timestamp to create a line break without a gap.
* We **highly recommend** using [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/) to help you with transcribing videos. Just give it the file or YouTube link you are transcribing and copy / paste your finished work to the comment fields.

Hey, thanks for joining me today! This is the Totally Unoriginal YouTube Unboxing Guy, here with another review and unboxing video! Heeere we go! 

(00:10)  
[*TUYUG Intro Theme plays.*]

(00:14)  
Here we can see that we have a box! And we need to open it!

(00:18)  
[*TUYUG looks for scissors.*]

(00:33)  
[*Box is opened, and inside is a large toy snoo. It looks almost exactly like TUYUG, wearing a fedora and Hawaiian shirt. TUYUG begins playing with it, making him dance, wiggle about, and tip his fedora. Vuvuzelas sound and klaxxons blare as dubstep music plays in the background.*]

(1:00)  
[*TUYUG finishes playing with the snoo, and reluctantly puts him down.*] Alright guys, that's all the time we have for today, don't forget to hit that like button, comment and subscribe. This is the Totally Unoriginal Unboxing Guy, peace!
