If you're reading this, the transcription post leads to a website or format that we might not usually transcribe! **Choose the most applicable format guide from below to follow**, and if you have any questions, message the moderators through [Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTranscribersOfReddit) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/M9uhCyj)!

**Note:** To use these format guides, all you have to do is copy and paste everything after the line break and before the line break preceding "*END*", and replace the carets and the values inside them. The two asterisks turn any text between them into boldtext, and the three hyphens in a row when separated by a blank row above and below will become a horizontal rule.
