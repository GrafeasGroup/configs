Images can come from anywhere, so if we don't have a specific format guide or if you're in doubt stick to a simple format - Header, image description (if any), text transcription, footer.

Whether it's Snapchat, Twitch, Omegle, Tumblr, Instagram or the next social media website that hasn't been invented yet - add the title at the top and take it from there, as neatly as possible. If you're uncertain, feel free to message the mods for guidance or advice, we're here to help!

Important: As always, when copying and pasting, remember to replace the prompts with their relevant information and content.

If the text to be transcribed includes emojis, please copy and paste the emoji into your transcription; we suggest [emojipedia.org](http://emojipedia.org/). 

Format:

    *Image Transcription: Source Name*

    ---

    [*Description of images, if any.*]

    **Name of Poster**: Text of post.

**Useful Notes:**

* Names are usually censored for privacy reasons, if this is the case, please use the color of the text bubble i.e. \*\*Blue\*\*, \*\*Grey\*\*, etc.
* Please only include dates/times if they are relevant to the content being transcribed. If the date, for any reason, only provides a relative timestamp (i.e. 6h ago, now, etc) do **not** include a date and time.
