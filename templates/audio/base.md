This poem is called, "Metaphysical Poem".

(0:09)  
Which, I guess, you may feel, uh, no great interest in metaphysical poetry. Which is [entirely?] correct.

(0:21)  
When do you want to go?

(0:23)  
I'm not sure I want to go there.

(0:25)  
Where do you want to go?

(0:27)  
Any place.

(0:28)   
I think I'd fall apart any place else.

(0:31)  
Well, I'll go if you really want to.

(0:33)  
I don't particularly care.

(0:35)  
But you'll fall apart any place else.

(0:37)  
I can just go home.

(0:38)  
I don't really mind going there.

(0:40)  
But I don't want to force you to go there.

(0:43)  
You won't be forcing me, I'd just as soon.

(0:46)  
I wouldn't be able to stay long anyway.

(0:48)  
Maybe we could go somewhere nearer?

(0:50)  
I'm not wearing a jacket.

(0:52)  
Just like you weren't wearing a tie.

(0:54)  
Well, I didn't say we had to go.

(0:56)  
I don't care whether you're wearing one.

(0:58)  
We don't really have to do anything.

(1:00)  
Well all right, let's not.

(1:01)  
Okay, I'll call you.

(1:02)  
Yes, call me.

(1:04)
