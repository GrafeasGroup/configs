We highly recommend using [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/) to help you with this. Just give it the YouTube link to the audio you are transcribing and copy / paste your finished work to the comment fields.

**Audio Formatting:**
---

Make a time mark anytime something happens to break the flow of audio, like a speaker finishing a paragraph or something happening where it makes logical sense to insert a break. Timestamps are enclosed (by parentheses), dialogue is unbounded, and anything other than verbal dialogue is enclosed [in brackets].

For audio *shorter* than one hour:

Time: minute:second --> (00:00)

For audio *longer* than one hour:

Time: hour:minute:second --> (00:00:00)

NOTE: There are **two spaces** after the timestamp, then a **return/enter** to make it look:

instead of:

*EXAMPLE*

(00:00)   
Hello! I'm going to be speaking to you today about the benefits of Vim, Emacs, and why having a flame war between the two is both totally unnecessary and 100% necessary... *all at the same time*. [scattered laughter]

(00:21)  
We'll also be taking a look at the topics you see on the screen...

...etc.
